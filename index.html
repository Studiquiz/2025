        <p><strong>1. Scope</strong></p>
        <p>These Terms and Conditions (AGB) apply to the use of the online quiz “Studiquiz”, provided for study and research purposes. Participation is voluntary.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Conditions of Participation</strong></p>
        <p>All individuals who access the quiz and fill in the pseudonym field may participate. There is no obligation to provide personal data. The pseudonym entry is required to enable the awarding of bonus points, but this pseudonym will not be linked to the actual identities of the participants during data analysis.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Purpose of the Quiz</strong></p>
        <p>The quiz serves to collect anonymized usage and response data for scientific purposes. No individual evaluations are created, no personal conclusions are drawn, and no commercial purposes are pursued.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Voluntary Data Submission</strong></p>
        <p>At the end of the quiz, participants may download a CSV file containing their own answers and accompanying data. Sharing or uploading this file (e.g., on eCampus or other platforms) is voluntary. Transmission is only required if participants explicitly agree to the analysis of their data. Without such transmission, no data will be processed or stored on the server.</p>
        <p><strong>5. Data Usage and Anonymization</strong></p>
        <p>The collected data, including quiz answers, time spent on pages, click behavior, modal openings, and navigation paths, will be stored and analyzed exclusively in anonymized form. Before analysis, the pseudonym is completely removed, preventing any subsequent identification. Further details on data processing can be found in the privacy policy.</p>
        <p><strong>6. Disclaimer</strong></p>
        <p>The provider assumes no liability for technical malfunctions, data loss, or incorrect displays. Participation is at one’s own risk.</p>
        <p><strong>7. Changes to the Terms</strong></p>
        <p>These Terms and Conditions may be modified at any time. The current version is available when starting the quiz. By using the quiz, participants agree to the applicable version.</p>
        <p><strong>8. Contact</strong></p>
        <p>For questions or concerns regarding participation and data usage, please contact: s6cestar@uni-bonn.de</p>

        <p>This quiz runs entirely locally in the browser. We do not actively transfer any data to a server. During use, the following information may be stored locally:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Answers to quiz questions</li>
          <li>Stated field of study</li>
          <li>Interaction behavior with individual elements (e.g., navigation, modal openings)</li>
          <li>Consent information regarding legal notices</li>
          <li>Time taken to answer individual questions</li>
          <li>Free-text responses</li>

        <p><strong>3. Purpose of Processing & Handling</strong></p>
        <p>Processing is carried out for anonymized evaluation for scientific purposes. The goal is to study technical usage behavior and response patterns. Pseudonyms are removed before analysis. No tracing back to individuals occurs. Researchers and course participants only have access to these data if they agree to maintain confidentiality and accept the conditions stated in this document. No identifying information will be mentioned in publications or presentations.</p>
  
        <p><strong>4. No Tracking, No Central Storage</strong></p>
        <p>We do not collect or store IP addresses, device identifiers, or other metadata. However, see GitHub hosting for further details.</p>
  
        <p><strong>5. Optional Data Sharing via CSV Export</strong></p>
        <p>After completing the quiz, a CSV file containing the locally stored data can be downloaded. This file is not sent automatically. Only through manual upload (e.g., to eCampus) can it be shared.</p>
        <p>By voluntarily uploading, you consent to anonymized analysis. Without upload, all data remain stored locally. After upload, the data will be used for both teaching and research. If you are aware of this, please enter the word "Eis" for the first question.</p>
  
        <p><strong>6. GitHub Hosting</strong></p>
        <p>This website is hosted via GitHub Pages (GitHub, Inc., 88 Colin P Kelly Jr St, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA). When accessing the site, GitHub may process technical access data such as IP address or timestamps. This processing occurs independently of the quiz and is outside our control.</p>
        <p>More information: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Privacy Statement</a></p>
  
        <p><strong>7. Storage Duration and Control</strong></p>

        <p>The data we store or that are exported are used exclusively for scientific purposes. They are not shared with third parties nor used commercially.</p>
  
        <p><strong>10. Legal Basis</strong></p>
